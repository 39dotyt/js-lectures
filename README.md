JS lectures and programs, written for KubSAU students

To get source code, you should properly set up git.

Looking for how to setup git? Look [here](http://git-scm.com/).

After you just should execute next commands in Git Bash:

```bash
$ cd path/to/your/code/directory # which could be whenever your want
$ git clone https://github.com/39dotyt/js-lectures.git
```

Now you can access every project directory. For next steps see indirectory READMEs.
